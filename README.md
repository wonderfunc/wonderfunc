# Wonderfunc

This is a collaborative end of degree project together with the student [Tomás Denis Reyes Sánchez](https://github.com/toderesa97) directed by José Juan Hernández Cabrera from SIANI (Las Palmas of Gran Canaria) and supported by Jose Évora Gómez from Monentia (Las Palmas of Gran Canaria).

Wonderfunc is a distributed stream based on JAVA Stream API. The main difference is that Wonderfunc instead of been executed in a local machine, is executed in a distributed environment.

Those distributed environments could go from a Hadoop cluster until AWS Lambda. Initially the AWS Lambda based environment will be implemented. Later on other will be added.
